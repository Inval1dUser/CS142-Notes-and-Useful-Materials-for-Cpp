# CS142 Notes and Useful C++ Resources and Materials
#### Please let me know if there is anything you would like me to add
--------
##### - Note: This is just a list of stuff that I found personally useful

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg)

- ### Cheat Sheets/Guides/References
  - [How to Program in C++](http://www.cheat-sheets.org/saved-copy/how2cpp.20210603.html)
  - [GeeksForGeeks C++ Cheat Sheet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/)ðŸ”¥
  - [Quickref.me for C++](https://quickref.me/cpp) - This isn't the most in-depth resource out there, but it is a good quick reference cheat sheet. 
      - They also have a [Github page](https://github.com/Fechin/reference/blob/main/source/_posts/cpp.md)
  - [Hacking C++](https://hackingcpp.com/tags/article.html)
  - [C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)ðŸ”¥
  - [CPlusPlus](https://cplusplus.com/)
  
- ### Websites/Learning Tools
  - [Learn C++ by Example](https://www.cbyexample.com/) 
  - [GeeksForGeeks - C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/)
    - This is the same website as stated previously, but I am putting it again as it has a really good practice/learning tool
  - [HackerRank for C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)
    - In my opinion, better for practicing than [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/), but it does not have any of the reference tools.
    
- ### Other Lists, 
#### Please note that these other lists are almost all for things other than learning, such as frameworks, libraries, engines, and other things of that nature. 
  - [Awesome-Cpp](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp) - I've noticed this one being the most linked-to list when asked about C++ resources
  - [Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects) - List of projects that anyone can do/solve - This could also go with the learning tools tbh.
  - [Cpp-Links](https://github.com/MattPD/cpplinks)
  - [Lefticus' C++ guide](https://lefticus.gitbooks.io/cpp-best-practices/content/02-Use_the_Tools_Available.html) - Similar to [Awesome-Cpp](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp)
  - [Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/books/free-programming-books-subjects.md) - list of programming guides, manuals, and other books.
  - [Resources for Student Programmers](https://github.com/AchoArnold/discount-for-student-dev#readme) - Includes discounts and resources
  
## I'm giving this one it's own section just because of it's sheer size and broad expanse of programming and development related topicc
  -  ### [AwesomeLists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) - Resource Hub for Programming, Development, and Miscellaneous Topics

- ##### I will most likely be uploading my class notes onto here just as a way to keep them backed up and archived. If I do end up uploading my notes onto here, you are free to use them as you please.
